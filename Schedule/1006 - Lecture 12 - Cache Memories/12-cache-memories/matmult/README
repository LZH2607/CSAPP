This is the code that generated the various matrix multiplication 
performance charts in Introduction to Computer Systems.

Files:

# Conventional matrix multiply
mm.c		- driver for the 6 different version of mat mult + 6 matrix multiply functions

# Timing routines
clock.{c,h}	- routines for accessing timers
fcyc.{c,h}	- routines that use the K-best scheme for estimating
	          the number of cycles required by a function.
